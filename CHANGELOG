    + cl31 reader
        - correct bug with CBH and CLH. Instead of converting data in feet to meters, coefficient was applied to data in meters
        - add test to check the conversion of data is working
        - the bug was already corrected in reader for swiss airport data

* v2.1.7
    + create a reader specifically for CHM15k data from UK metoffice
    + correct errors in E-PROFILE configuration files examples

* v2.1.6
    + improve managing of time variable in the creation of netCDF file
        - a new type has been added: `$time$`
        - section about time variable are required to have `units` and `calendar` options (compatible with netCDF-CF convention)
        - update all configuration files examples with the new `$time$` type for time variables
    + chm15k reader
        - add variable `start_time`
    + cl31 reader

    + vaisala reader
        - correct bugs detected by MetOffice and add tests
        - change how instruments messages are printed. Instead of doing it for each time step a summary is done at the end of the reading
    + chm15k-nimbus reader
        - correct bugs detected by Metoffice and add tests
        - change how instruments messages are printed. Instead of doing it for each time step a summary is done at the end of the reading
        - it is now possible to give to pass the overlap using TUB*.cfg from lufft with -anc command line options. It allows a better checking of the size and could be used during the reading

    + change logger message to make them compatible with eprofile
    + create conf file for eprofile. Compare to TOPROF version, only the global variable are changed
    + allow user to chose the value of missing value in the reader configuration file. It needs to be taken into account in the data reader
    + add options to check size and timeliness of input files and data
    + add possibility to give several input files or pattern as argument in the command line
    + a value from the reader can now be put in a netCDf attribute
    + correct the bug making it impossible to have a different level of logs in the console and in the file
    + correct minor bugs creating the logging of warnings
    + vaisala reader
        - add a modified version of the reader to process swiss airports files
        - add decoding of instrument message. They are printed in the log during processing in any found

        - check scale value. data without a scale of 100% will be logged
        - correct a bug making the the tilt angle a scalar value instead of a time depending variable
    + chm15k-nimbus
